```lrc
[00:24.41] Sheitan never came so ill, he got skill
[00:27.23] Met a brother from the drill that gave my spine chills
[00:29.95] All thirty three nerves
[00:31.86] Controlling my curves
[00:32.89] Common sense just swerved every time I got served
[00:35.59] Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric
[00:39.10] Cold as winter in Connecticut
[00:40.50] Compassion lacking deficit
[00:42.06] Thought it was love like, sent from above
[00:44.74] You not a soul-mate
[00:45.89] More ways and actions of a primate
[00:47.99] Who by low and census coming faker than extensions
[00:49.34] Pissed away all good intentions
[00:50.71] Outta here sister was missin'
[00:52.06] Intuition
[00:53.19] Maybe it was me
[00:53.97] I couldn't see
[00:55.09] Holdin onto fantasy
[00:56.34] Getting bitten by reality
[01:08.84] 
[00:58.20] War wound, purple heart, love veteran
[01:01.12] Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
[01:03.89] Anything just to forget the hurt, incoming!
[01:07.62] Take cover, hit the dirt
[01:09.42] On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
[01:12.60] And the POW's get left behind
[01:15.34] Mentally scarred for life, love is war
[01:18.55] And some chicks are just too hard to wife
[01:39.05] 
[01:21.80] I shoulda deaded it from genesis
[01:23.43] 'Stead of hittin' the Guinnesses
[01:25.12] Now I'm free falling
[01:26.56] Cursing at the street. bawling
[01:28.12] He ceased calling
[01:29.26] No appetite for feast darling
[01:30.81] So deep. all in, I bet he never stop balling women
[01:33.80] Forsake God for the scent of a man
[01:36.45] Sacrifice a whole life for a slice, overstand?
[01:39.68] Maybe it's a lack of pigment
[01:40.99] Loneliness imagine figment
[01:42.35] Only got the car tinted to pull extra G's in it
[01:45.24] Damn Jody, comin with the okie doke, pokie poke
[01:48.44] Steady rockin boats, got me aimin for ya throats
[01:51.14] Sniper scope
[01:52.25] Weren't we supposed to elope?
[01:53.89] Propose then ya froze, I don't think that I can cope
[02:19.89] 
[02:20.15] Constant frustration, stemming from a no win situation
[02:22.81] Rushing lust and fornication
[02:24.47] Adding to the complication
[02:26.03] Patience is a virtue
[02:27.32] Pain run deep when love desert you
[02:28.95] Listenin' to whisperin'
[02:30.26] Choosing chaos over discipline
[02:31.67] Simpleton, life should really be a piece of intimance
[02:34.60] Relationships strengthening
[02:36.18] Flower essence: Penstemon
[02:37.73] Gentlemen, my favorite shit, so I've never forsaken it
[02:40.42] I persevere, make it fit, sculpting and reshaping it
[02:43.49] Taking sips off a fifth of it
[02:45.99] Passionate, intense
[02:47.21] Incense candles lit, scandalous
[02:49.11] Emotional bandages, why would he abandon this?
[02:52.66] Guess he couldn't handle it, the boss is magnanimous
